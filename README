This module is meant to deploy a complete redmine setup, including database(s) and webserver with config.

This module should work on:
* CentOS 5.4 and up
* CentOS 6.x
* Archlinux latest
Support for Debian/ubuntu should arrive someday, when I have some spare time ;)

Dependencies:
* mysql module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-mysql
* apache module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-apache

If I forgot anything, or plain simply screwed up, let me know.
