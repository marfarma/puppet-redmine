This module is meant to deploy a complete redmine setup, including database(s) and webserver with config.

This module should work on:
* CentOS 5.4 and up
* CentOS 6.x
* Archlinux latest

Partial support for Debian 6.0.x, lacking vhost config for now.
Support for ubuntu shouldn't be too hard considering most stuff is there for Debian.
Might do it some time soon when I find some spare time.

Dependencies:
* mysql module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-mysql
* apache module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-apache
* vhost module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-vhost
* passenger module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-passenger

NOTE:
The redmine is installed from a tarball, included in the repo.
It is based on the official 1.2.1 tarball, but is patched to allow for private comments on issues.
More about the patch can be found here: http://www.redmine.org/issues/1554

If I forgot anything, or plain simply screwed up, let me know.
