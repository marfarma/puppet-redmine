This module is meant to deploy a complete redmine setup, including database(s) and webserver with config.

This module should work on:
* CentOS 5.4 and up
* CentOS 6.x
* Archlinux latest

Partial support for Debian 6.0.x, lacking vhost config for now.
Support for ubuntu shouldn't be too hard considering most stuff is there for Debian.
Might do it some time soon when I find some spare time.

Dependencies:
* mysql module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-mysql
* apache module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-apache
* vhost module: https://github.com/simonsd/puppet-vhost

If I forgot anything, or plain simply screwed up, let me know.
